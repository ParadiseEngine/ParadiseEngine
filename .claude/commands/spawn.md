# Spawn Agent

Spawn a teammate agent from the project's agent definitions in `.claude/agents/` and add it to the current team.

## Arguments

`$ARGUMENTS` — format: `<agent-type> [issue-number] [extra context]`

Examples:
- `/spawn dev 1` — spawn dev for issue #1
- `/spawn pm` — spawn the PM agent
- `/spawn qa` — spawn QA agent

## Instructions

### Step 1: Parse arguments

Extract from `$ARGUMENTS`:
- **agent-type** (required): one of the agent files in `.claude/agents/` (pm, dev, qa)
- **issue-number** (optional): GitHub issue to work on
- **extra-context** (optional): additional instructions

If agent-type is missing or not found in `.claude/agents/`, list available agents and ask the user to pick one.

### Step 2: Ensure a team exists

Check if a team is active. If not, create one with `TeamCreate` (team name: `paradise-dev`).

### Step 3: Read the agent definition

Read `.claude/agents/<agent-type>.md` to get the full agent definition.

### Step 4: Determine spawn configuration

| Agent | Isolation | Mode |
|-------|-----------|------|
| pm | none (root project) | auto |
| dev | worktree | auto |
| qa | worktree | auto |

**Model**: Do NOT set the `model` parameter on the Agent tool. The model is defined in each agent's `.md` file and will be used automatically.

### Step 5: Pre-create worktree (if needed)

For agents that need a worktree (dev, qa):

**CRITICAL**: Always create worktrees from the root project directory `/home/quabug/ParadiseEngine` on `main` branch. NEVER create worktrees from inside another worktree.

```bash
cd /home/quabug/ParadiseEngine
git pull origin main
git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<agent-type>-<issue-number>-<short-desc> origin/main -b issue-<issue-number>-<short-desc>
```

If no issue number, use a descriptive name:
```bash
git worktree add .claude/worktrees/<agent-type>-<task-desc> origin/main -b <agent-type>-<task-desc>
```

### Step 6: Spawn the agent as a teammate

Use the Agent tool with:
- **name**: `<agent-type>-<issue-number>` (e.g., `dev-1`) or `<agent-type>` for PM/QA
- Do NOT set `model` — let it inherit from the agent definition file
- **mode**: `auto`
- **team_name**: `paradise-dev`
- **prompt**: Include the full agent definition from the .md file, plus:
  - The issue number and instructions to read it with `gh issue view <number>`
  - The worktree path (if applicable)
  - Reminder to follow `.claude/rules/development-workflow.md`
  - CRITICAL warning about working only in their worktree

### Step 7: Confirm

Report to the user:
- Agent name and type
- Issue number (if any)
- Worktree path (if any)
- Team membership

## Rules

- **Always read the agent definition file** — never hardcode agent prompts
- **PM runs on root project only** — never in a worktree
- **Only one PM at a time** — check if a PM is already running before spawning
- **Pre-create worktrees from root project** — never from inside another worktree
- **Fetch latest main** before creating worktrees
- **Always add to team** — agents must be spawned as teammates, not background tasks
